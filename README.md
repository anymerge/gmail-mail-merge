# AnyMerge Mail
With [AnyMerge Mail](https://mail.anymerge.com/), you can merge spreadsheet data into Gmail messages as **text values**, **images**, or **QR codes**. You can also add multiple attachments.

**There is no daily sending limit!** Plus, take advantage of two-phase merge, where you can literally create thousands of Gmail drafts first and then send them out later.

A few highlights of the add-on:
- **built** from the ground up **for heavy-duty work**
- merges text values, links, **QR codes and images** into Gmail messages
- **add multiple Google Drive files as attachments**
- automatically converts Google files (Docs, Sheets and Slides) to PDF
- supports two-phase merge
- automatically saves and restores merge configuration; configure a merge job once, then just run it

## INSTALLATION
You can install the add-on from the [Google Workspace Marketplace](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/anymerge_mail/176776676167) or from the [AnyMerge Mail website](https://mail.anymerge.com/).

## MOTIVATION
My motivation was to build a suite of add-ons that excel in one thing: reliability.
My background is system integration, and I built these add-ons from the ground up to be as reliable as possible.
There is a lot of logic under the hood to make sure they deliver results as promised.
[AnyMerge](https://www.anymerge.com/) add-ons are meant for heavy-duty work,
whether you want to send hundreds of personalized emails with the [AnyMerge Mail](https://mail.anymerge.com/) add-on,
or generate hundreds of Google Documents with the [AnyMerge Docs](https://docs.anymerge.com/) add-on.

## NEW KID ON THE BLOCK
The AnyMerge Mail add-on for Google Spreadsheets is the new kid on the block. There are plenty of other mail merge add-ons, yet AnyMerge Mail stands out and offers features that other add-ons do not have.

## NO DAILY SENDING LIMIT
While other mail merge add-ons let you send just a fraction of your daily quota allowed by Google for free, **AnyMerge Mail add-on does not have a daily sending limit at all**. Your only limit is the type of Gmail account you use. With a Gmail business account, you can send up to 1 500 personalized emails per day from the add-on and reach your audience with ease.

## USE IT FOR FREE
You can use the add-on absolutely free of charge. Well, there is a small catch when using the add-on for free â€” the add-on appends a link to each message you send. I am more than happy to see people using the add-on for free but spread the word. I put a lot of effort into developing this tool.

## MERGE QR CODES AND IMAGES INTO GMAIL MESSAGES
AnyMerge Mail does not just do simple text merge. You can use it for pretty complex operations like merging multiple QR codes, or images as well as attachments into Gmail messages.

## ADD MULTIPLE ATTACHMENTS
Furthermore, the add-on allows you to take multiple attachments from your Google Drive and include them in Gmail messages, so you can further automate your daily workflows. You can use the AnyMerge Docs add-on to generate Google Documents, then send them as attachments with the AnyMerge Mail add-on.

For example, you can generate a bunch of invoices first with the AnyMerge Docs add-on, then send them with the AnyMerge Mail add-on. You can streamline the entire process and move from your manual, error-prone method to a smooth, automated workflow.

## TWO-PHASE MERGE
One of the unique features of the add-on is the so-called two-phase merge. The add-on can merge spreadsheet data into Gmail drafts, and you can send the drafts later. Why would this be useful?

The two-phase merge is particularly handy for long-running tasks where you would like to process hundreds of emails with a very complex setup. Doing a simple merge of text values into Gmail messages is fast. Once you start adding more complex things like QR codes or multiple attachments, processing times will increase, and you can easily end up with processing times over one minute for a single message.

With two-phase merge, you can let the add-on create drafts only first (phase one).
Depending on how many emails you would like to process, it might take several hours to complete.
Just make sure your workstation will not go to sleep and keep an eye on the process.
Or run the merge job overnight.
Once the merge job is over and all those drafts are sitting in your draft folder, you can send them out (phase two).
Sending pre-made drafts is much faster.

Another great advantage is that there is no daily quota on how many drafts you can create. You can create literally thousands of drafts per day and send them later in smaller batches.

Take advantage of two-phase merge when your merge setup is complex and takes a long time to finish. Generate drafts first and send them later.

## NO EMAIL TRACKING
The add-on does lack some features that other add-ons provide. Most prominent is email tracking. If this is the top feature you are looking for, do not waste your time and look for other solutions. I am not going to implement this feature in the foreseeable future.

## PRIVACY MATTERS
Once any add-on has access to your Gmail, it can access your Gmail messages, and there is a possibility of leaking private data. The AnyMerge Mail add-on cannot make external requests, meaning that there is no way the add-on can send your data to a third party. At installation, you need to grant permission and authorize the add-on. For a detailed explanation of what the add-on does, please read the privacy policy before you install the add-on.


Happy merging!
